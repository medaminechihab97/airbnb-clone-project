## 👥 Team Roles

### 🔧 Backend Developer
**Project Responsibility:**
- Develop and maintain RESTful and GraphQL API endpoints using Django REST Framework and Graphene.
- Write business logic for user registration, authentication, property management, booking flow, payment handling, and review systems.

- Perform unit and integration testing, ensuring endpoint stability and expected behavior.

---

### 🗃️ Database Administrator (DBA)
**Project Responsibility:**
- Design and maintain the relational database schema for all core entities: Users, Properties, Bookings, Reviews, and Payments.
- Create and manage indexing strategies and foreign key relationships for optimal query performance.
- Implement caching mechanisms using Redis for frequently accessed data and session storage.
- Handle data migrations, backups, and ensure data integrity across development and production environments.

---

### ⚙️ DevOps Engineer
**Project Responsibility:**
- Containerize the application using Docker to ensure consistency across local development, staging, and production environments.
- Set up and maintain CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate testing, building, and deployment processes.
- Monitor system health, implement logging solutions, and configure alerts for infrastructure performance and downtime incidents.
- Manage deployment environments and scale backend services based on usage demand.

---

### ✅ QA Engineer
**Project Responsibility:**
- Define and implement test cases for all API endpoints and user scenarios, both automated and manual.
- Test for edge cases, data validation errors, authentication bugs, and performance bottlenecks.
- Work with developers to identify and resolve regressions during continuous deployment cycles.
- Document testing procedures and provide quality assurance reports before production releases.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

| Technology       | Purpose in Project |
|------------------|--------------------|
| **Django**       | High-level Python web framework used to implement backend logic and manage application structure. |
| **Django REST Framework (DRF)** | Adds flexible and customizable tools for building RESTful APIs to support CRUD operations. |
| **GraphQL (Graphene-Django)** | Provides a flexible query interface to retrieve nested data efficiently from the backend. |
| **PostgreSQL**   | Main relational database for structured data such as users, properties, bookings, and payments. |
| **Redis**        | In-memory data store used for caching, session management, and speeding up frequent queries. |
| **Celery**       | Asynchronous task queue used for running background jobs like sending confirmation emails or processing payments. |
| **Docker**       | Ensures consistent development and deployment environments through containerization. |
| **GitHub Actions** | Used to define and manage CI/CD workflows for building, testing, and deploying the backend automatically. |

## 🗃️ Database Design

The database uses a normalized relational structure with key entities and well-defined relationships:

### 🔸 Users
- `id`: Unique user identifier
- `email`: User's email address (unique)
- `password`: Encrypted password
- `full_name`: Full name of the user
- `is_host`: Boolean flag indicating if the user can list properties
- 🔗 *Relationships*: A user can own multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

---

### 🔸 Properties
- `id`: Unique identifier for the property
- `title`: Title or name of the property
- `location`: Address or geolocation data
- `price_per_night`: Rental price per night
- `owner_id`: Foreign key to the user (host)
- 🔗 *Relationships*: A property is owned by one user and can receive multiple bookings and reviews.

---

### 🔸 Bookings
- `id`: Booking identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key to the booking user (guest)
- `property_id`: Foreign key to the booked property
- `check_in`: Date of arrival
- `check_out`: Date of departure
- 🔗 *Relationships*: A booking is made by one user for one property.

---

### 🔸 Reviews
- `id`: Review identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key to the review author
- `property_id`: Foreign key to the reviewed property
- `rating`: Integer score (e.g., 1-5)
- `comment`: Text content of the review
- 🔗 *Relationships*: A user can leave multiple reviews; each review is linked to a single property.

---

### 🔸 Payments
- `id`: Payment identifier
- `booking_id`: Foreign key linking to the booking
- `amount`: Total transaction amount
- `status`: Status of payment (e.g., pending, successful, failed)
- `timestamp`: Time of payment
- 🔗 *Relationships*: Each payment is tied to one booking only.

## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

### 👤 User Management
Provides functionality for user registration, login/logout, profile updates, and authentication using JWT. Hosts and guests are identified based on a user role flag.

### 🏠 Property Management
Hosts can create, read, update, and delete property listings. Each property contains information like price, availability, and location.

### 📅 Booking System
Allows users to view available properties and make reservations for specific dates. It also supports modification and cancellation of bookings.

### 💳 Payment Processing
Handles secure payment transactions tied to bookings. Integrates with third-party gateways and logs transaction history and statuses.

### 🌟 Review System
Users can leave feedback for properties after their stay, including ratings and written comments. Helps maintain transparency and quality.

### 🚀 Data Optimization
Implements indexing on frequently queried fields and uses Redis for caching search results and session data to reduce server load.

## 🔐 API Security Overview

### 🛡️ JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
**Purpose:**  
Used for stateless user authentication across the API. After logging in, users receive a token that must be included in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests.

**Benefits:**
- Stateless: No need to store session info on the server.
- Compact and fast to validate.
- Helps prevent unauthorized access to protected endpoints.

---

### 🔒 HTTPS Enforcement
**Purpose:**  
All API communication is conducted over HTTPS to ensure data is encrypted during transit.

**Benefits:**
- Protects against man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Safeguards sensitive information like passwords and payment data.

---

### 🧾 Input Validation & Sanitization
**Purpose:**  
Validate all incoming data at both the serializer (Django REST Framework) and database level.

**Benefits:**
- Prevents SQL Injection, XSS, and other injection attacks.
- Ensures data consistency and integrity.

---

### 📋 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Purpose:**  
Restrict actions based on user roles (e.g., admin, host, guest).

**Benefits:**
- Prevents unauthorized data access or modification.
- Ensures only permitted users can perform specific actions.

---

### 🧮 Rate Limiting & Throttling
**Purpose:**  
Implemented using Django REST Framework’s throttling features.

**Benefits:**
- Protects against brute-force attacks and abuse of public APIs.
- Ensures fair usage of resources.

---

### 🔁 Refresh Tokens
**Purpose:**  
Short-lived access tokens are paired with refresh tokens to reduce risks from stolen tokens.

**Benefits:**
- Enhances session security.
- Reduces the damage window if a token is compromised.

---

### 📊 Monitoring & Logging
**Purpose:**  
Monitor API requests and log abnormal or unauthorized activities.

**Tools:**
- Sentry for error tracking.
- ELK stack or built-in Django logging.
