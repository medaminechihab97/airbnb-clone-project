## üë• Team Roles

### üîß Backend Developer
**Project Responsibility:**
- Develop and maintain RESTful and GraphQL API endpoints using Django REST Framework and Graphene.
- Write business logic for user registration, authentication, property management, booking flow, payment handling, and review systems.
- Integrate backend services with PostgreSQL and asynchronous task queue Celery for handling delayed jobs (e.g., email notifications).
- Perform unit and integration testing, ensuring endpoint stability and expected behavior.

---

### üóÉÔ∏è Database Administrator (DBA)
**Project Responsibility:**
- Design and maintain the relational database schema for all core entities: Users, Properties, Bookings, Reviews, and Payments.
- Create and manage indexing strategies and foreign key relationships for optimal query performance.
- Implement caching mechanisms using Redis for frequently accessed data and session storage.
- Handle data migrations, backups, and ensure data integrity across development and production environments.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è DevOps Engineer
**Project Responsibility:**
- Containerize the application using Docker to ensure consistency across local development, staging, and production environments.
- Set up and maintain CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate testing, building, and deployment processes.
- Monitor system health, implement logging solutions, and configure alerts for infrastructure performance and downtime incidents.
- Manage deployment environments and scale backend services based on usage demand.

---

### ‚úÖ QA Engineer
**Project Responsibility:**
- Define and implement test cases for all API endpoints and user scenarios, both automated and manual.
- Test for edge cases, data validation errors, authentication bugs, and performance bottlenecks.
- Work with developers to identify and resolve regressions during continuous deployment cycles.
- Document testing procedures and provide quality assurance reports before production releases.
